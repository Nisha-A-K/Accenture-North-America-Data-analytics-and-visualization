# Accenture-North-America-Data-analytics-and-visualization
I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics &amp; Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context. 
Through this program I
•	Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture
•	Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions
•	Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
• Realized that I really enjoy cleaning, modelling and analysing client data, creating slides to communicate findings and presenting insights back to the client. I would love to apply what I've learned in a diverse project team at a company like Accenture.
